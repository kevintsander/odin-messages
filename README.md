# README

This project demonstrates the use of standard Rails Websockets and actioncable to deliver real-time chat messageing updates. This method follows the typical rails channel setup and requires Javascript to modify the page, as is specified in the [The Odin Project Websockets and Actioncable lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-websockets-and-actioncable) ([instructions](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/blob/main/ruby_on_rails/mailers_advanced_topics/actioncable_lesson.md)).

See my other project [here](git@github.com:kevintsander/odin-messages-turbo.git) for another implentation which was created an experiment to see if I could create the same functionality with Turbo Streams instead.
